    <div class="desc"><span style="font-weight:600;font-size:40px;line-height:90px">______</span><br>
        Crafted exclusively in the town of Patan in Gujarat,<br>
        the Patola is a unique kind of Sari. The exquisiteness<br>
        of this craft lies in the special "double Ikat" technique<br>
        used to create a myriad of intricate patterns. Meticulous<br>
        precision, geometric ingenuity and copious amounts of <br>
        sheer focus and dedication is what makes every Patola<br>
        Sari a prized possession. An heirloom that is passed from <br>
        mother to daughter. A Sari that takes almost a year to be <br>
        created, a heritage that lasts generations. <br>
        <br>
        Scroll down to experience the uniqueness <br>
        of the technique yourself.</div>

        The vertical threads in a Sari are known as "Warp" <br>
        The horizontal threads are called "Weft". Based on<br>
        how many times the pattern repeats vertically and<br>
        horizontally the threads are bundled together to <br>
        mark the gridlines to create the Pattern.<br>
        <br>
        Let's try to understand this intricate process by<br>
        scaling up one motif to see what is happening.<br>

<div class="desc"><span style="font-weight:600;font-size:40px;line-height:90px">______</span><br>
       The patterns on a Patola Sari are not "printed".<br>
        Instead, they emerge out of individual threads<br>
        that have been pre-dyed in different parts based<br>
        on one of the traditional designs. To form the <br>
        as accurately as possible, extreme care needs to<br>
        taken in arranging the threads so that they line <br>
        up precisely. Both during dyeing and weaving.<br>
        
    <br>
        Let's look at the journey of the yarn from <br>
        being white to being dyed with the pattern.

    <div class="desc"><span style="font-weight:600;font-size:40px;line-height:90px">______</span><br>
    The white silk yarn is tied to set up the weft.<br>
    Then, the gridlines needed to create the pattern <br>
    are marked with a thread soaked with black coal.<br>
    Every square unit of the pattern is actually made<br>
    of 24 threads! Accordingly, just the warp of the <br>
    Sari is made up of <span style="font-weight:600">5,760 </span>individual threads.

    <div class="desc" style="top:14%"><span style="font-weight:600;font-size:40px;line-height:90px">______</span><br>
        Based on the markings, two people begin tying <br>
        the areas that form some part of the pattern.<br>
        The parts that are tied will not be exposed to <br>
        the dye. In this way, only the areas that have <br>
        the first color will get dyed. When the threads <br>
        are soaked in the dye, the lightest colours are <br>
        dyed first and the dark colors are dyed in <br>
        the end.<br>
        <br>
        This is to optimise the amount of tying needed <br>
        and also as to protect the light colours as they <br>
        can't be dyed over darker colours.<br>
        <br>
        In this animation, the pattern has been enlarged<br>
        for better visibility. The actual motif is much <br>
        smaller and the tying, way more intricate.<br>
        <br>
    <br>

    <div class="desc"><span style="font-weight:600;font-size:40px;line-height:90px">______</span><br>
        After the first colour has been tied, the thread <br>
        bundles are dyed in the first colour. All the <br>
        exposed, untied areas absorb the colour of the <br>
        dye. This dyeing technique of resisting certain <br>
        parts of the yarn from being coloured by tying <br>
        them is known as "Ikat"<br>
        <br>
        The Patan Patola stands out from other kinds of<br>
        Ikat because of two reasons:<br>
        <br>
        1) They use the "double Ikat" technqiue in which<br>
        both the warp AND the weft are dyed. <br>
        2) The colour dyes used in Patan are authentic <br>
        natural dyes as opposed to the widespread<br>
        chemical dyes used elsewhere.<br>

        Once the threads are dyed in the first colour,<br> 
        the second round of tying begins. This time<br>
        the tied areas will retain the dyed colour <br>
        and the exposed areas will be completely <br>
        dyed in the second, darker colour.<br>
        <br>
        This process of tying and dyeing is repeated<br>
        according to the number of colours required <br>
        in the design.<br><br>

    <div class="desc"><span style="font-weight:600;font-size:40px;line-height:90px">______</span><br>
        After the second round of tying is done, <br>
        the thread bundles are dyed again in the <br>
        second colour. Being darker, the second<br>
        colour covers the previous colour completely  <br>
        except in the newly tied areas where the  <br>
        first colour gets retained.<br>
        
        This process of tying and dyeing is repeated  <br>
        as many times as the number of colours in the  <br>
        design. In the <span style="font-weight:600">double Ikat</span>
        technique used <br>
        by Patan Patola weavers, the process is done<br>
        for <span style="font-weight:600">both</span> the warp and the weft.

        After all the colours have been dyed, it is time<br>
        to remove all the threads to see the pattern that<br>
        has finally emerged. In this way one of the most<br>
        tedious parts of the process is completed..<br>

    <div class="desc"><span style="font-weight:600;font-size:40px;line-height:90px">______</span><br>
        Once both the warp and weft have been dyed<br>
        in all the colours, a team of 2-3 people stretch<br> 
        and arrange the warp across a traditional loom. <br>
        The threads bundles need to be separated and <br>
        arranged with extreme care as one misplaced <br>
        thread can ruin the whole sequence.  The weft <br>
        threads are wound onto a reel and attached to <br>
        a bamboo shuttle.  <br>
        <br>
        The weaving process requires two people, one <br>
        person controls the shedding and arranges any <br>
        misaligned threads with three needles in a hand. <br>

        The other person helps in passing the shuttle  <br>
        and checking the thread arrangement.<br>
        <br>
        Because of the complexity of the patterns and  <br>
        the alignment required, only 20-25 centimeters  <br>
        of a sari can be woven each day. In this way,  <br>
        the entire process of making a patola, from  <br>
        preparing the yarns to weaving the Sari can  <br>
        take about 4-11 months depending on the  <br>
        pattern. Single Ikat Saris can be produced <br>
        faster than the "Double Ikat ones.
